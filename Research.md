# Clustering of Unlabeled Data #
    An attempt at understanding relationships among features within a dataset through clustering techniques that do not mandate a pre-defined number of clusters.
## Overview ##
Overall Goal: <insert goal>.  
Personal Goals: <insert goal>. (optimized cleaning functionality, merge multiple sources --> finding versions, pull from multiple data sources --> requests, csv, sql, etc).
Given that I had no initial intuition on the correct way to achieve this goal, I started by defining the following roadmap for the several functionalities that this project involved.  
I was exploring a space of data science with which I was unfamiliar, and apparently the internet was too.
