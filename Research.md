# Automated data organization through dimensional modeling on arbitrary datasets #

A routine practice of clustering that often gets overlooked is visualizing the data to reveal the number of clusters / partitions the dataset has. By utilizing high-level visualization tools, data scientists are often able to eyeball the number of clusters they see fit. In doing so, data scientists can interpret the hidden relationships among features within a given dataset; however, not everyone has the power to do so. As companies become more data-driven in their decision-making, the importance for all employees to understand how to make data-driven decision grows. Moreover, a tool that could assist in exploring the <insert purpose> could <speed up decisions drastically and help all employees understand the hidden dynamics of their data through one simple process>. Leveraging hierarchical clustering and data transformation tools, 


Start with a problem people try to solve. Routine piece of data science and BI that 
Business Problem: Lots of people do these things by hand in data science. This is a tool that can help automate processes where businesspeople can organize data themselves
An attempt at understanding relationships among features within a dataset through clustering techniques that do not mandate a pre-defined number of clusters.
## Overview ##
Overall Goal: <insert goal>. This is a piece of a bigger system. Only have done a subset of it. Then go into the subset. My particular sphere of interest was within this subset.
Personal Goals: <insert goal>. (optimized cleaning functionality, merge multiple sources --> finding versions, pull from multiple data sources --> requests, csv, sql, etc).
Given that I had no initial intuition on the correct way to achieve this goal, I started by defining the following roadmap for the several functionalities that this project involved.  
I was exploring a space of data science with which I was unfamiliar, and apparently the internet was too.

MENTION CRITERIA: run automatically, but may need to be adjusted by human. run interactively, user introduces dataset, so it needs to be relatively quick.
    
## Data Transformations ##
talk about after clustering --> then explain the data to explain how I went about doing it.
    
## Heuristic Approach ##
make sure to section on alternatives does not occupy too much time. make only 10% of full thing.

discuss pairwise distance and how it didnt work because it correlated by data points not by overall features.
Not about producing numbers; it's also about reasoning. How do we automate decisions regarding the number of clusters or deciding whether one feature belongs to one cluster or another. Use one feature to predict another.

## Gaussian Mixture Model Approach ##

## K-Means Clustering Approach ##

## Hierarchical Clustering Approach ##
Do first. How it works before what you did to make it work.
